Drumador is a play on the Irish word 'drumadóir', meaning 'drummer'.

The original inspiration for this project was to provide a practice tool to assist musicians in playing Traditional Irish Music. 
Drum loops are a useful alternative to practicising with a metronome. 
Given the unique rhythms and limited online resources available for Traditional Irish Music, I believe this project offers significant potential.
The current live example contains a number of miscellaneous drum samples alongside a few Traditional Irish 'bodhrán' options.
The recording of additional samples in the Traditional-Irish style is a work in progress.


On the technical side of things, the app is written with Vue.js and deployed on Google Firebase.
Using a Vue 'list filter', it is possible for users to filter loops by genre and time signature.

On desktop devices playback speed can be controlled with either your cursor or left/right arrow keys, and playback can be paused/restarted with your spacebar key.
